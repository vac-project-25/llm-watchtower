# Project Watchtower: AI & Data Vacationers Project Brief

## AI Use Cases for Defence, Law Enforcement and Intelligence

---

## Project Overview

You will work in a small team to explore how AI can be applied to real world challenges in the domains of **Defence**, **Law Enforcement**, or **Intelligence**. Your goal is to:

- Identify **2–3 high-impact AI use cases** relevant to these sectors.
- Design **one** use case into a **proof of concept (PoC)** using open data or a synthetic dataset.
- Build a **prototype** that demonstrates the core functionality.
- Present a short **AI strategy deck** that explains the business value, data needs, and risks.

---

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Research and identify use cases  
- **Week 2**: Select one use case and design the PoC  
- **Week 3**: Build the prototype  
- **Week 4**: Finalise the strategy deck and present your work  

---

## Deliverables

### Use Case Summary (1–2 pages)

- Problem statement  
- Target users/stakeholders  
- Expected impact  
- Why AI is suitable  

### Proof of Concept Design

- Data sources (open or synthetic)  
- AI technique (e.g., NLP, computer vision, anomaly detection)  
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, etc.)  

### Prototype

- Codebase (Python preferred or anything else?), use of GitHub for version control  
- Simple UI (optional)  
- README with setup instructions  

### AI Strategy Deck

- Business value  
- Data requirements  
- Risks (bias, privacy, misuse)  
- Next steps for scaling, integration and stakeholder engagement

## Additional Guidance

To help you succeed:

- Use open datasets (e.g., Kaggle, government portals) or create synthetic data if needed.  
- Focus on feasibility: you don’t need to solve everything, just demonstrate the core idea.  
- Think critically about risks: consider ethical, legal, and operational implications.  
- Collaborate and document: keep notes, share progress, and ask questions.

## What You’re Being Assessed On

- Creativity and relevance of use cases  
- Clarity and feasibility of your PoC  
- Functionality and presentation of your prototype  
- Strategic thinking in your final deck

## Things for AI & Data Team to Consider (Before Giving to Interns)

- Do we need to give them a client/stakeholder to consult with?  
  - A mapping of users/stakeholders that would benefit from the solution once they’ve identified their preferred use case?  
- Deployment considerations, i.e. where and how their proposed solution could be deployed?  
- Security and compliance overview in Defence – anything they’d need to consider?  
- Relevance and explainability for non-technical users?  
- Should we generate the dataset we’d like them to use?

## Some Suggested Use Cases (from Copilot)

### Anomaly Detection in Border Surveillance

Use AI to detect unusual patterns in border crossing data.

- **Open datasets**: UNODC crime statistics, border traffic data.

### Predictive Policing for Urban Crime Hotspots

Use historical crime data to forecast high-risk zones.

- **Open datasets**: NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics, Kaggle crime datasets.

### Threat Intelligence from Open-Source Data

NLP to extract threat indicators from news, forums, and social media.

- **Open datasets**: Reddit, Twitter (via API), news archives.
