# vac-project
Vacationer Project 2025

## Getting started

Start with the Vacationers Guide for goals, milestones, and how to run the scripts:

- docs/vacationers_guide.md
- docs/api_llm_setup.md

Quick smoke tests (after setup):

- Hello LLM: `python -m src.hello_llm -q "One sentence about Watchtower"`
- Deterministic analytics: `python -m src.analyze_text -f data/animals.txt -q duplicates`
